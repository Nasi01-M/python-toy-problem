## Overview

In this repository, you will find solutions to three different toy problems implemented in Python. Each challenge tackles a specific problem statement and offers a Python function to solve it. The challenges include:

- **Challenge 1**: Minimum Moves for Target Bricks
- **Challenge 2**: Maximum Sum of Equal Digit Sums
- **Challenge 3**: Generating Strings with Equal Letter Counts

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Minimum Moves for Target Bricks

Given an array representing the number of bricks in each box, the task is to determine the minimum number of moves needed to end up with exactly 10 bricks in every box.

### Challenge 2: Maximum Sum of Equal Digit Sums

Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum.

### Challenge 3: Generating Strings with Equal Letter Counts

Given an integer `N`, generate a string of length `N` containing as many different lowercase letters as possible, in which each letter occurs an equal number of times.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the Python code implementing the solutions to the challenges.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

## Usage

You can run the `main.py` file to test the solutions for each challenge. Each solution function is provided with example usage at the bottom of the file.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the repository.
3. Run the `main.py` file to test the solutions or integrate them into your project as needed.
